SICP group
==========

Each chapter should use its own directory (named `chN`, where N is the
chapter number). Each exercise should be in its own file, and named
`exN.scm`. Try to make each exercise as self-contained as possible -
no relying on external files or libraries. I'm sure this will involve
some repeating of code, but it will be easier for the group to analyze
each exercise in isolation.

Happy hacking!
